The FHS standard defines four hierarchies of directories used in organizing the files of the filesystem. The top-level or root hierarchy follows:

Directory	Contents
/	The base of the structure, or root of the filesystem, this directory unifies all directories regardless of whether they are local partitions, removable devices or network shares
/bin	Essential binaries like the ls, cp, and rm commands, and be a part of the root filesystem
/boot	Files necessary to boot the system, such as the Linux kernel and associated configuration files
/dev	Files that represent hardware devices and other special files, such as the /dev/null and /dev/zero files
/etc	Essential host configurations files such as the /etc/hosts or /etc/passwd files
/home	User home directories
/lib	Essential libraries to support the executable files in the /bin and /sbin directories
/lib64	Essential libraries built for a specific architecture. For example, the /lib64 directory for 64-bit AMD/Intel x86 compatible processors
/media	Mount point for removable media mounted automatically
/mnt	Mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems manually
/opt	Optional third-party software installation location
/proc	Virtual filesystem for the kernel to report process information, as well as other information
/root	Home directory of the root user
/sbin	Essential system binaries primarily used by the root user
/sys	Virtual filesystem for information about hardware devices connected to the system
/srv	Location where site-specific services may be hosted
/tmp	Directory where all users are allowed to create temporary files and that is supposed to be cleared at boot time (but often is not)
/usr	
Second hierarchy

Non-essential files for multi-user use
/usr/local	
Third hierarchy

Files for software not originating from distribution
/var	
Fourth hierarchy

Files that change over time
/var/cache	Files used for caching application data
/var/log	Most log files
/var/lock	Lock files for shared resources
/var/spool	Spool files for printing and mail
/var/tmp	Temporary files to be preserved between reboots
